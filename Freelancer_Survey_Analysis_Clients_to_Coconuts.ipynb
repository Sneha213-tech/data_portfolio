The polls were taken to help give him an insight into the average freelancer, enabling him to produce higher quality content on his website [CoachLancer](https://www.coachlancer.com/). CoachLancer aims to assist anyone on the freelancer journey, with advice ranging from getting more clients to general pro tips. You may also know Mikko as 'that coconut guy from LinkedIn'.\n",

I also thought that it may be helpful to visualize the data so that anyone interested can quickly analyze the data and find their own insights. This data gives a window into the life of a freelancer. As a result, it is primarily aimed at anyone currently working as a freelancer or interested in becoming one. If you're not in that boat but would still like to dig into the findings, please feel free to continue!
